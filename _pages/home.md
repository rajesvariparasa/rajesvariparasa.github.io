## About me

<em>Hi! I am Rama Kamala Rajeswari Parasa (or just Rajeswari!). I am a geospatial researcher and an Erasmus Mundus scholar currently pursuing Master's with the Copernicus Digital Earth Program at the University of Salzburg, Austria and University of South Brittany, France with a specialisation in geodata science. Besides remote sensing and spatial analytics, my research interests include urban planning and public policy. </em>
