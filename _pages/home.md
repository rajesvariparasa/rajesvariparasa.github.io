## About me

<p style = "text-align:justify">
Hi! I am Rama Kamala Rajeswari Parasa (or just Rajeswari!). I am a geospatial researcher and an Erasmus Mundus scholar currently pursuing Master’s with the Copernicus Digital Earth Program and specialising in geodata science, at the University of Salzburg, Austria and University of South Brittany, France. Besides remote sensing and spatial analytics, my research interests include open data, urban planning and public policy.
