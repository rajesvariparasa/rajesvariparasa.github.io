## Projects & Experiences
<ol start = "1">

<li><strong>Timeseries Classification for Crop Identification | Using LSTM</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa</em><br>
This project demonstrates time-series classification for crop identification on a subset of the MiniTimeMatch dataset by training a deep learning model with an LSTM architecture. The notebook showcases data exploration, setting up a data preparation pipeline using a custom dataset class, and finetuning the model architecture and the training loop. Code showing usage of trained models for inference on new data in also included.

<li><strong>Housing Price Prediction</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa & <a href = "https://candelasolpelliza.com/">Candela Sol Pelliza </a></em><br>
The project produced a set of notebooks detailing data exploration and preparation followed by a demonstration of three regression models applied to the data with different configurations. These different models include Basic Linear Regression, Linear Regression with ElasticNet Regularization, Random Forest Model, Random Forest with Boruta Feature Selection, and Catboost Model. The notebooks also demonstrate workflows for hyperparameter tuning for each of the models.

<li><strong>Summer'23 Internship</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa</em><br>
In the summer of 2023, I interned with the EO Analytics team of the ZGIS department at the University of Salzburg, Austria. Under the guidance of Assoz. Prof Dirk Tiede and Dr Martin Sudmanns, I developed a series of automated workflows to query EO data cubes generated using sen2cube.at infrastructure built on Sentinel-2 data and its semantically enriched data. The workflows are aimed at exploring the potential of EO data cubes in building ESG indicators for monitoring real-estate properties. More specifically, I propose a 'green score' that can be monitored over time to assess the green cover and its changes on a property parcel. I also build a workflow for retrieving the 'semantic history' of a property parcel. These two exercises hint at the potential of EO data cubes in monitoring and assessing the sustainability of real-estate properties.

<li><strong>Interactive tool for visualising Delhi Draft Master Plan 2041</strong><br>
<em><a href= "https://nikhilvj.co.in/">Nikhil VJ </a> and Rajeswari Parasa</em><br>
We built the tool to make the spatial data of the draft plan more accessible to researchers and citizens. The tool was used by the <a href = "https://www.mainbhidilli.com/">Main Bhi Dilli campaign </a> as part of their work to raise awareness about the plan among people.

<li><strong>Exploring spatial routing libraries in python</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa</em><br>
In this notebook, I explore Networkx & OSMNx, OSRM (free and open source) and Google Maps Direction API for finding street network based routes between a set of origin-destination (O-D) points and compare them visually.

## Working Papers and Reports

<ol start = "4">
<li><strong>Methods to measure spatial access to healthcare facilities in cities: A case study of the urban poor in Chennai (2021)</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa, Harsh Vardhan Pachisia and Isalyne Gennaro</em><br>
The study explores open-source tools and libraries to analyse geographic distances from slums to the nearest primary healthcare centres in an Indian city. It argues for undertaking similar geospatial analysis while planning new health facilities.

<li><strong>Embed open data principles in Master Plans to make planning more inclusive and participatory</strong><br>
<em>Rajeswari Parasa and Harsh Vardhan Pachisia</em><br>
In the context of Delhi Master Plan 2041, we argue for opening up spatial datasets generated through city plans to improve public participation.

<li><strong>How Well Did Bed Capacity Respond To Patient Needs In Mumbai?</strong><br>
<em>Nikita Kwatra and Rajeswari Parasa</em><br>
In this piece, we analyse COVID-19 bed capacity and occupany data published by Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai to better understand the system's response to the surge of infections over time. We also look at the usefulness of monitoring test positivity rate to better prepare for upcoming infection surges and demand for hospital beds.
