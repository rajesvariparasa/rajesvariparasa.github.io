Hi! I am Rama Kamala Rajeswari Parasa (or just Rajeswari), a geospatial researcher and currently a student at the University of Salzburg, Austria and University of South Brittany, France. I am an Erasmus Mundus scholarship holder for the MSc Copernicus Digital Earth Program and will be specialising in geodata science. Besides remote sensing and spatial analytics, my research interests include open data, urban planning and public policy. You can look at some of my work <a href = "/writing/">here</a>.
