Hi! I am Rajeswari, a geospatial researcher. I recently completed my master's at the University of Salzburg, Austria and the University of South Brittany, France. I am an Erasmus Mundus scholarship holder for the MSc Copernicus Digital Earth Program, specialising in geospatial data science. Besides remote sensing and spatial analytics, my research interests include open data, urban planning and public policy. You can look at some of my work <a href = "/writing/">here</a>.
